A CPE 551 Project

A photography exercise module that suggests themed challenges for photographers of all experiences and provides feedback on lighting and composition using Gemini AI endpoints. 

I also think that more features can be added such as a photo culling system that deletes photos that are unfocused, a top-ten favorite photos using Excel as a database, or even finding a way to store the feedback of each photo submitted to the system.
